## CLIENT INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Immediate Setup
1. Extract application files to desired directory
2. Run startup script (`start-windows.bat` or `start-unix.sh`)
3. Access application at `http://localhost:5000`
4. Login with default credentials and change password immediately

### 2. Network Access (Multiple Computers)
1. Find server computer's IP address
2. Other computers access via `http://[SERVER_IP]:5000`
3. Ensure all computers on same network
4. Configure firewall to allow port 5000

### 3. Data Management

## SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Change Default Password**: Update admin password on first login
2. **Create User Accounts**: Set up individual accounts for each employee
3. **Network Security**: Restrict network access if needed

### Production Environment
1. **Environment Variables**: Set SESSION_SECRET in production
2. **HTTPS**: Deploy with SSL/TLS certificates
3. **Regular Backups**: Implement automated backup strategy
4. **Updates**: Keep Node.js and dependencies updated
