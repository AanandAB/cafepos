# Client EXE Handover Guide - Café Management System

## Overview
This guide explains how to create and deliver a complete Windows executable package to your client for immediate use without any technical setup.

## Building the Executable

### Method 1: Automated Build (Recommended)
Run the automated build script that creates everything in one step:

```bash
# Windows Command Prompt
build-exe.bat

# OR use the comprehensive builder
create-full-exe.bat
```

This creates:
- `cafe-management.exe` - Main application executable
- `cafe-management-win.exe` - Windows-optimized version
- Required dependencies and assets bundled

### Method 2: Manual Build Process
If automated build doesn't work:

```bash
# 1. Build the frontend
npm run build

# 2. Create executable with PKG
npm run build:exe

# 3. Package for Windows
npm run package:windows
```

## What Gets Created

### Executable Files
- **cafe-management.exe** - Single-file application (recommended for handover)
- **cafe-management-win.exe** - Windows-specific optimized version
- Size: Approximately 80-120MB (includes Node.js runtime)

### Supporting Files
- **README.txt** - Quick start instructions for client
- **SETUP_GUIDE.pdf** - Detailed setup and usage guide
- **cafe.db** - Empty database (gets created on first run)
